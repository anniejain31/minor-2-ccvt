# Meta-Heuristic Load Balancing Algorithms In Cloud Computing
This project focusses on Meta-Heuristic Load Balancing Algorithms in Cloud Computing, which aim to improve resource utilization and overall system performance in cloud environments. Through this project, I gained hands-on experience in designing and implementing meta-heuristic algorithms such as Genetic Algorithm, Particle Swarm Optimization, and Ant Colony Optimization to optimize load balancing in cloud computing.

The project involved conducting a comprehensive literature review to identify the most promising meta-heuristic techniques for load balancing, followed by the development of a simulation environment to test and evaluate the algorithms' performance. I also leveraged data analysis techniques to generate insights into the algorithms' behavior and effectiveness under different cloud workload scenarios.

Overall, this project allowed me to deepen my understanding of cloud computing, optimization techniques, and data analysis. I am excited to continue exploring this field and applying my knowledge to real-world challenges.
